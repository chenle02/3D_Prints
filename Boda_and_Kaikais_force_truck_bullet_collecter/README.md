This is a trailer for my Force Truck M35A2 

Vehicle Description
The RC M35A2 is a 6×6 off-road military-style truck designed for rough terrain. It features:
Three driven axles (6WD)
High ground clearance
Rigid ladder-frame chassis
Rear cargo bed suitable for scale accessories or towing
This model is intended for scale realism, not speed. It performs best at low speeds with high torque, similar to the real vehicle.
📐 Dimensions
All dimensions are for the entire truck, measured bumper-to-bumper.
Overall Length: (fill in your measured value)
Overall Width: (fill in your measured value)
Overall Height: (fill in your measured value)
Ground Clearance: (optional)
Dimensions are listed below to help with scaling accessories and trailer design.
🔗 Rear Hitch / Towing Setup
The real M35A2 uses a pintle hitch, and this RC model follows the same idea in scale.
Rear connection details:
Hitch type: Pintle-style / hook-and-loop (scale)
Mounting point: Rear frame cross-member
Purpose: Towing light RC trailers or scale military loads
If no factory hitch is installed, a custom hitch can be mounted directly to the rear frame using:
A metal loop or eyelet on the truck
A matching hook or lunette ring on the trailer
This setup allows vertical articulation, which is important for off-road driving.
🛠 Trailer Design Considerations
When building a trailer for this truck:
Keep the trailer width slightly narrower than the truck
Match wheel size and tire style for realism
Use a single-axle or tandem-axle layout depending on weight
Ensure the hitch allows up/down movement, not just rotation
Recommended trailer uses:
Cargo trailer
Military equipment trailer
Fuel or utility trailer
Flatbed for scale loads
🎯 Project Goals
Document accurate truck dimensions
Design a scale-correct trailer
Maintain military realism
Ensure compatibility with off-road driving
Allow future upgrades and modifications
🔧 Future Improvements
Planned or optional upgrades:
Improved rear hitch assembly
Suspension tuning for towing
Trailer lighting (scale or functional)
Additional scale accessories (jerry cans, crates, tarp)
Project Overview
This project is a 3D-printed RC-scale M35A2 military truck inspired by the real U.S. Army “Deuce and a Half.”
All major components, accessories, and future add-ons are designed with 3D printing in mind, allowing easy customization, repairs, and upgrades.
The focus is on scale realism, durability, and off-road capability, not high speed.
