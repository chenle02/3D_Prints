 # Codex CLI Instructions

 This repository stores 3D modeling projects. Each project is organized in its own subfolder containing model files and documentation.

 ## Repository Structure

 - `Tool_Organizer/`: First projectâ€”goody bag (tool organizer) for Kailai's birthday.

 ## Guidelines

 - When adding a new 3D modeling project:
   - Create a new subfolder named after the project.
   - Place source files (.3mf) and export files (.stl, archives) inside.
   - Add a `README.md` in the project folder describing the design, listing files, and providing printing instructions.
   - Update the top-level `README.md` to include the new project.

 ## Workflow

 1. Commit model files and documentation.
 2. Use Git LFS for large binary files if necessary.
 3. Tag releases for distribution.
